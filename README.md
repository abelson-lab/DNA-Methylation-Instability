# DNA-Methylation-Instability
This repository contains code to reproduce all analyses and figures from \<citation\>.

### Dependencies
#### Python:
- pandas
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pyreadr
- sksurv
- lifelines
#### R
- 

### Running the scripts
After setting up your environment and cloning the repository, execute the scripts from the command line or an IDE of your choice. Auxiliary data files necessary for some of the analyses are stored in `data/`. Larger files, such as Î²-value matrices, can be downloaded from Zenodo \<URL\> and placed in the `data/` directory. Required files are listed at the top of each script.

Source data files for the figures will be created in `plots/inputs`. All figures can be generated by running `plot_figures.R`, which saves them to `plots/figures`.
